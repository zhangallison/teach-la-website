<h2 class="title">Our Mission.</h2>
<p>
    ACM Teach LA's core mission is to empower students in the LA area with the power of computer science, and to provide mentorship and support to students who want to pursure computer science, either academically or as a career.

<h2 class="title">Why Teach LA?</h2>
<p>
    As of 2018, <a href="https://code.org/files/2018_state_of_cs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only 22 out of 50 states</a> have K-12 computer science standards, and only <a href="https://code.org/files/2018_state_of_cs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">35% of public high schools in America</a> teach computer science. Specifically, students from minority backgrounds receive the least exposure to computer science, especially as school districts serving minority communities often lack STEM funding.
</p>
<p>
    ACM Teach LA aims to fill this gap by providing schools and students with in-school and extracurricular support. Our flagship program consists of quarter to year-long structured classes on various computer science topics (basic programming, web development, machine learning, data science, computer graphics), backed by robust and structured curriculums and student tutors with academic and industry experience. We've also developed an open-source online code IDE, with the goal of supporting students' computer science learning regardless of their access to a certain type of computer. We also perform outreach, either through events (e.g. Day of Code) or by visitng schools and talking to students.
</p>
<h2 class="title">How does Teach LA Work?</h2>
<p>
    Classes are taught once to twice a week, typically sized between 15 and 25 students, and are lead by UCLA undergraduate students with academic, personal or industry experience in computer science. Undergrads meet once a week with our Curriculum Director before each class to prepare for weekly lessons. 
</p>
<p>
    If you are an undergrad not specifically interested in teaching but still want to contribute to Teach LA’s mission, we have a dev team in which undergrads maintain and expand Teach LA’s website. Dev team meets weekly on a separate schedule that varies. 
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, Teach LA has other outreach events with schools in the LA area. This may include speaker events in which undergrads give a talk on a specific topic within computer science or day long activities with a given school. 
</p>
<h2 class="title">What Do Students Learn?</h2>
<p>
    Depending on the group of students and their coding backgrounds, we shape the class to maximize their learning. Topics that students have learned in the past include programming fundamentals (in Python or Scratch) and intro to web development (in HTML/CSS). We’re looking to expand our set of topics to the following but not limited to machine learning, data science, and computer graphics.
</p>
<p>
    You can find out more on our <a href="/resources">resources page</a>.
</p>
<h2 class="title" id="school-join">We're a School/Organization. Can We Work Together?</h2>
<p>
    Of course! Currently, we're looking to partner with schools to run quarter/year-long curriculums, as well as running one-off instructional and networking events. If you're interested, please send an email to <a href="mailto:acmteachla@gmail.com">acmteachla@gmail.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">About ACM</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.uclaacm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM</a> is the largest computer science student organization at UCLA. It is split into eight committees (of which ACM Teach LA is one), each serving a different topic and mission. ACM regularly holds events for the UCLA community with the goal of giving students more opportunities to explore different aspects of computer science. UCLA students are encouraged to attend as many of the events as they'd like (they're free, beginner-friendly, and have free food). Organizations looking to work with ACM @ UCLA should contact ACM at <a href="mailto:acm@ucla.edu">acm@ucla.edu</a>.
